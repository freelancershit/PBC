            <p>PBC Sunbeam School is a ministry of the Plaridel Bible Church. It was established in 1991 with only the pre-elementary
              department. It started with the churchâ€™s group of women teaching the children around the local community of
              Bintog. Soon enough they were recognized by the Department of Education. Slowly but surely, the school began
              to grow. It established its elementary department in 1996 and the high school department in 2001. Since the
              school is a ministry of the church, the ownership lies with the church. There is no sole owner of the school.
              The school also is a non-stock, non-profit school, so all the money the parents of the students are paying
              revolves around the school expenditures.</p>

            <p>The school seal is a symbol of the PBC Sunbeam School. The touch symbolizes the enlightened leadership of the
              administrators, faculty and staff. The book stands for wisdom and knowledge. It also represent the Bible as
              ultimate source of knowledge from God. The dove represents God the Holy Spirit who serves as our guide and
              great comforter. The number 1991 is the year the school was founded. The name of the school and the place where
              it is located is written around the symbols shown by a circular shape that embodies the holistic goal of the
              school and oneness among the members of Sunbeam School family.
