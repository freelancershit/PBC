                      <li>The schedule for release of report cards every grading period is indicated in the school calendar. During this time, the school conducts a parents-teachers meeting so as to provide a venue for parents to confer with teachers with regard to their children’s academic performance and behavior in school.</li>
                      <li> In case a child has failures, the report card will not be issued. One week ahead of the distribution date, the parent/guardian shall receive notice of failure through the class adviser, indicating the subjects in which his child failed. The parents are encouraged to come on the distribution day to confer with the teachers to help the child cope with his difficulties.</li>
                      <li>Parents and guardians are requested to sign at the back of the report card and have it returned immediately to the class adviser. Lost cards will be replaced at a fee, and shall require the submission of affidavit of loss.</li>
                      <li>Tampering with the report card is strictly prohibited. If the report card is damaged, soiled or folded upon its return, the parent/guardian shall be required to pay its replacement.</li>
